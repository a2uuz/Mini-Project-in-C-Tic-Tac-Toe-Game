This Tic Tac Toe C game is such that you will have to input a numerical character, from 1 to 9, to select a position for X or O into the space you want. 
For example: if you are playing with O and you input 2, the O will go to first row – second column.
If you want to place O in third row – first column, you have to enter 7. And, it is similar for the other positions.

This has been done this way because it is just a console application without graphics designed in C language. 
The gotoxy function has been used to print text in any part of the screen.

ENJOY !!
